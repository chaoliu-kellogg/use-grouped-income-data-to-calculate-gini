# Using Grouped Income Data to Calculate the Local Gini Coefficient
I compare two methods to use grouped income data to calculate the local Gini coefficient.

The first method uses a user-written program called inequal7.

The second method applies the formula of the Gini coefficient to perform matrix calculations. 

The preferred method depends on the number of locations you have.
